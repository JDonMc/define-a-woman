What is a woman?

A woman has a specific XX biology with tits and clits eggs and hormonal sqings.

A healthy woman has a healthy identity of herself. She thinks she identifies as a woman, but just because a woman is her identity does not mean because she identifies as a woman she is a woman. You are what WE identify you as. Because if you don't let what WE identify you as matter at all, then you are not in a democracy. You are in a selfish dictatorship of the self. An imagination. And you have broken from the herd which is psychotic.
