For each file in the folder "woman" we will discuss all the properties of a woman.

For each file in the folder "defining-a-woman" we will discuss all the definitions of a woman.

For each file in the folder "what-woman-does" we will discuss everything a woman does.

For each file in the folder "definitions-of-women" we will discuss the cost of changing the definition of a woman.

For each person voting they must say if they are a women under EACH AND EVERY definition.
This way we can see who is voting on what, if all trans women think one way and breeding women think another way then we can discuss this also.

The idea is to be transparent, as transparency is the future.
